# Performance Testing(Booking)
### Hello and welcome! This GitHub repository contains the performance testing documentation for restful-booker.herokuapp.com, for a collection of API with various HTTP methods. Here, performance testing is done using Jmeter to determine the maximum load capacity of this collection of API to be called without any errors when a huge number of concurrent threads(users) are made.

All the test files (jmx, jtl & html files) are included in this repository and the following is a report of all the test procedures and reports.

# Types of Performance Testing
## 1.Load Testing
## 2.Stress Testing
## 3.Endurance Testing
## 4.Spike Testing

# Load Testing
### checks the application’s ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live
# Collection of API
### A set of API for restful-booker.herokuapp.com covering various HTTP methods i.e. POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT are used for test data. Data is set, called, then updated using token and then deleted using token all within this set of API for this test coverage.

# Summary Of Load Testing
### .While executing 100 concurrent threads(users), a total of 600 requests are made with error rate 0.00%.

### .While executing 150 concurrent threads(users), a total of 900 requests are made with error rate 0.00%.

# Stress Testing
### involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application.

# Endurance Testing
###  is done to make sure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time.

# Spike Testing
### tests the software’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.

# Conclusion
### Therefore from this in-depth performance testing of restful-booker.herokuapp.com for a collection of API using three Thread Groups, it is determined that the maximum load capacity of running the aforementioned collection of APIs without any errors is 900 concurrent threads and with very minor errors (less than 1%) is 900 concurrent threads. Using threads any more than this causes significant amount of errors.
